The **OperantAuditoryTraining_PlusMaze** repository contains code and related files for operantly training rodents on an auditory classification task on an automated plus maze. Full instructions for how to build the automated plus maze associated with this code can be found [here](http://www.mit.edu/people/tpbrawn/wares_APlusMaze.html). The automated plus maze contains a response port and syringe pump controlled by an Arduino stack at the end of each arm of the maze. This repository contains code for running a 2-alternative choice auditory classification task (2AC folder) and a series of shaping procedures (Shape folder) to incrementally train the rodents how to interact with the maze in order to complete the 2AC task.
